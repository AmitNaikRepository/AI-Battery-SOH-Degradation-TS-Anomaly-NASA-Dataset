## 🔧 Feature Engineering

**See detailed feature engineering process**: [`feature_creation.ipynb`](./feature_creation.ipynb)

Feature engineering is crucial; it's the art of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs.
It directly impacts model performance, allowing algorithms to uncover hidden patterns more easily.
A well-engineered feature can significantly boost accuracy and predictive power , often more so than complex model tuning.
Ultimately, it ensures the model speaks the language of the business problem, leading to deployable value.

### **From 5 features from input to 32 created 30 derived features and use 18**


The features are categorized into:

1. **Raw Measurements** (3 features)
   - `Voltage_measured`
   - `Current_measured` 
   - `Temperature_measured`

2. **Statistical Features** (5 features)
   - `capacity_trend_5`: Capacity trend over last 5 cycles
   - `voltage_rolling_mean_5`: 5-cycle rolling mean of voltage
   - `temp_rolling_mean_5`: 5-cycle rolling mean of temperature
   - `capacity_velocity`: Rate of capacity change
   - `capacity_acceleration`: Rate of change of capacity velocity

3. **Cycle Information** (2 features)
   - `cycle_normalized`: Normalized cycle number [0-1]
   - `cycles_from_start`: Absolute cycle count

4. **Derived Features** (8 features)
   - `voltage_change`: Voltage differential
   - `resistance_proxy`: V/I ratio estimate
   - `internal_resistance`: Calculated internal resistance
   - `power_avg`: Average power during discharge

## 🚫 Data Leakage Prevention

### Removed Features (High Correlation with Target)

We identified and **removed 13 features** that caused data leakage:

![Data Leakage Analysis](../img_Data/degradation_3_leakage.png)
*Figure 3: Before vs After - Shows removed leakage features vs clean features kept*

**Excluded Features:**
```python
EXCLUDE = [
    'Cycle', 'Time', 'Capacity', 'Battery_ID',
    'capacity_fade_total',           # Direct calculation from capacity
    'capacity_fade_percent',         # Direct calculation from capacity  
    'discharge_capacity_ratio',      # = Capacity / initial_capacity
    'remaining_capacity',            # = Capacity - threshold
    'capacity_rolling_mean_5',       # ≈ Capacity itself (r=0.996)
    'capacity_rolling_std_5',        # High correlation
    'energy_discharged',             # = Capacity × Voltage (r=0.999)
    'voltage_capacity_ratio',        # Direct capacity ratio
    'power_to_energy_ratio',         # Derived from capacity
]
```

### Correlation Analysis
- **Before removal**: Some features had correlation > 0.99 with target
- **After removal**: All features have correlation < 0.90
- **Result**: Model performance dropped from 99.7% R² (leakage) to 88.4% R² (realistic)

## 🤖 Model Architecture

### XGBoost Configuration

```python
model = XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,        # Number of trees
    max_depth=5,             # Tree depth (prevents overfitting)
    learning_rate=0.05,      # Conservative learning rate
    subsample=0.8,           # 80% row sampling
    colsample_bytree=0.8,    # 80% feature sampling
    min_child_weight=3,      # Minimum samples per leaf
    random_state=42          # Reproducibility
)
```

### Why XGBoost?
- **Handles non-linear relationships**: Battery degradation is non-linear
- **Feature importance**: Identifies key degradation factors
- **Robust to outliers**: Battery data can have measurement noise
- **Fast training**: Efficient for our dataset size

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

```python
# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('processed_data/5_batteries.csv')

# Define features
EXCLUDE = ['Cycle', 'Time', 'Capacity', 'Battery_ID', ...]
features = [col for col in df.columns if col not in EXCLUDE]

# Split by battery
train_mask = df['Battery_ID'].isin(['B0005', 'B0006', 'B0007'])
test_mask = df['Battery_ID'] == 'B0018'

X_train = df[train_mask][features]
y_train = df[train_mask]['Capacity']
X_test = df[test_mask][features]
y_test = df[test_mask]['Capacity']

# Train model
model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=5, ...)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Test R²: {r2:.4f}")

## 🔬 Lessons Learned

### 1. Data Leakage is Subtle
- Initial model: 99.7% R² → Too good to be true!
- Root cause: Features like `energy_discharged` = Capacity × Voltage
- Solution: Systematic correlation analysis and removal

### 2. Battery-Level Split is Critical
- Random cycle split → Overoptimistic results
- Battery-level split → Realistic generalization
- Tests true deployment scenario

### 3. Domain Knowledge Matters
- Understanding battery physics helped identify leakage
- Physically meaningful features → Better interpretability
- Resistance and voltage features are key predictors

### 4. Good Performance ≠ 99% Accuracy
- **88% R² is excellent** for battery degradation prediction
- Real-world factors: manufacturing variability, usage patterns, environmental conditions
- **Honest metrics build trust** - Better than inflated 99% claims with data leakage
